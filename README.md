# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game offers both single-player and multiplayer modes, where players control their snakes to collect food and grow in size. The challenge is to avoid hitting the walls, your own tail, or the other player's snake in multiplayer mode.
